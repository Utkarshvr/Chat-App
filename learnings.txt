Before getting started we need to understand what is WebSocket & How is it different from HTTP

# WebSocket
- WebSocket is a computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. 
- The first time when client and server connects it connects with the help of http and then upgraded to another protocol request but that is changed from the HTTP protocol to the WebSocket protocol.
- And once the bi-direction connection is estabilished, it will be open & persistant.
- And if any one side (client or server) chose to close the connection, the connection will be closed from both sides.

# Differnce b/w Http & WebSocket
- Http is a request-response in which the connection is closed after a request from the client to the server or a response from the server to the client. Whereas WebSocket is a real-time, bidirectional, event-driven communication protocol that provides persistent connections between clients and servers.

# Socket.io
- Socket.IO is an event-driven library for real-time web applications. It enables real-time, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers. It consists of two components: a client, and a server. Both components have a nearly identical API.

# Benifits of using socket.io
- By connecting with a WebSocket protocol, we reduce the number of requests we send to the server and only one request is needed and after that connection will be open until disconnected by any one side.
- No need to use http polling (a process in which we send request to a server every few second or minutes to check if there is any additional change in response).

🔍 Before getting started, we need to understand what WebSocket & Socket.io are and how WebSocket differs from HTTP.



1. WebSocket 🌐🔌  

- WebSocket is a computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. 🔄🔗

- The WebSocket connection is established through a process known as the WebSocket handshake. Initially, when the client and server connect, they use the HTTP protocol. Then, the connection is upgraded to the WebSocket protocol, allowing for full-duplex, real-time communication. 🤝✨

- Once the bi-directional connection is established, it remains open and persistent. 🔒🔛

- If either side (client or server) chooses to close the connection, it will be closed from both ends. ❌🔒



2. Difference between HTTP & WebSocket 🔄🆚🌐

- HTTP operates as a request-response protocol, where the connection is closed after each request from the client or response from the server. In contrast, WebSocket is a real-time, bidirectional, event-driven communication protocol that provides persistent connections between clients and servers. 🔄🆚🌐



3. Socket.io 🔌💡

- Socket.IO is an event-driven library for real-time web applications. It enables real-time, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers. Socket.io builds on top of the WebSocket protocol, simplifying the implementation process. 🚀🌐

- Socket.io consists of two components: a client and a server, both with nearly identical APIs. 📱📡



4. Benefits of using Socket.io 💪🔌

- By connecting with the WebSocket protocol, we reduce the number of requests sent to the server, and only one request is needed for the initial handshake. After that, the connection remains open until disconnected by either side. 📈🔄🚀

- Socket.io eliminates the need for frequent HTTP polling, a process where requests are sent to the server every few seconds or minutes to check for any additional changes in response. This results in reduced network overhead and improved real-time responsiveness. 🚫🔄🕑
